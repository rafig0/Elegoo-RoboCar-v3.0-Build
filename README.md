# 🤖 Elegoo RoboCar - Hardware Assembly & Testing

> A hands-on robotics project built using the Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit.

This repository documents the **assembly and functional testing** of a 4-wheel autonomous smart car using the **Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit V3.0**. The project was focused on learning sensor integration, chassis assembly, and motion behavior using pre-programmed firmware provided with the kit.

## ⚙️ What I Did

- Assembled the full chassis and motor system
- Installed ultrasonic + IR sensors and servo
- Connected L298N motor driver with Arduino Uno
- Powered up and observed line-following & obstacle avoidance behavior
- Calibrated wheel alignment and sensor angles manually
- Gained understanding of how motors, sensors, and microcontrollers interact

## 📝 Note on Code

This kit came with **pre-loaded firmware** provided by Elegoo.  
I did not modify or view the code during this build — the focus was entirely on **hardware integration and system behavior testing**.
